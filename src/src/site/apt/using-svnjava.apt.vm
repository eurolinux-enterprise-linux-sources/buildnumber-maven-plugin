Using svnjava provider

  If you need to execute the plugin on machine without any svn in the path you can configure 
  the mojo to use the svnjava provider.

  NOTE the svnjava provider use the svnjava scm provider implementation {{{http://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/maven-scm-provider-svnjava/}maven-scm-provider-svnjava}} which rely on svnkit version.
